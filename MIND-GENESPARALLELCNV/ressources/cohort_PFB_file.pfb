THIS IS WHERE WE SAVE THE PFB FILE (require by PennCNV)
This is a tab delimited file with the header below:

Name	Chr	Position	PFB

header column definition:
Name: The array genotyping markers SNP name
Chr: SNP chromosome
Position: SNP genomic position as referenced by its chromosome
PFB: Population B allele frequency computed on the specific cohort data (by the PennCNV compute pfb plugin)
